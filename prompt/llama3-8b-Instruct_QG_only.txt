You are an expert in table data analysis. Given a table with its file name and a portion of its content (first ten rows), your task is to **generate questions** based on the table & headers.

    ### **Important Considerations:**
        - **Do not generate python code, generate questions on your own.**
        - The type of Questions could be one of (Numerical, List, Count, Select). 
        - **Generate question using the language of the table.**

    ### **Tasks:**
    **1. Generate Questions (Context-Specific to the Table):**
        - Formulate **questions that can only be answered using this specific table**.
        - Ensure **each question involves 1 to 3 different headers** to capture interactions between data & columns.
        - Ensure the header diversity in all the questions.
        - Use '' to mark the headers in the question.
        - **Total number of questions should larger than the half number of extracted headers**

    ### **Output Format (Strictly JSON format)**
    Only return a JSON dictionary object with the extracted headers and questions, without any additional explanations or formatting.
    ```
    {{
        "questions": ["question1", "question2", "..."]
    }}
    ```
    ### **Input Table:**
    {table}
