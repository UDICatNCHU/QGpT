You are an expert in table data analysis. Given a table with its file name, sheet name, and a portion of its content (first ten rows), your task is to **extract key headers and generate questions** based on the table & headers.

    ### **Important Considerations:**
        - The table may contain `nan` or `Unnamed:` values, which represent empty merged cells in the original table. These **should not** be considered as meaningful data points or headers.
        - The **true column headers may not always be in the first row or first column**. Carefully analyze the table to identify the correct headers.
        - If the table has **multi-level headers**, preserve the hierarchical structure without merging or altering the text.
        - If the table has an **irregular header structure** (such as key-value formatted headers where column names are listed separately), extract the correct header names accordingly.
        - **Ignore rows that contain mostly empty values (`nan`, `Unnamed:`) or placeholders without meaningful data.**
        - **Do not generate python code, extract headers and questions on your own.**
        - The type of Questions could be one of (lookup, calculate, visualize, reasoning). 
        - **Generate question using the language of the table.**

    ### **Tasks:**
    **1. Extract Header Names:**  
        - Identify the **true headers** by analyzing the structure of the table.
        - **Exclude** placeholder values like `"nan"` and `"Unnamed:"`.
        - If the table contains **multi-level headers**, keep them as separate levels without merging.
        - If the table has **key-value headers**, extract the correct column names.

    **2. Generate Questions (Context-Specific to the Table):**
        - Formulate **questions that can only be answered using this specific table**.
        - Ensure **each question involves 1 to 3 different headers** to capture interactions between data & columns.
        - Ensure the header diversity in all the questions.
        - Use '' to mark the headers in the question.
        - **Total number of questions should larger than the half number of extracted headers**

    ### **Output Format (Strictly JSON format)**
    Only return a JSON dictionary object with the extracted headers and questions, without any additional explanations or formatting.
    ```
    {{
        "headers": ["header1", "header2", "header3", "..."],
        "questions": ["question1", "question2", "..."]
    }}
    ```
    ### **Input Table:**
    {table}
