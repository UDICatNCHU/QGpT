It was first thought to be Geisha because of its aromatic profile . However , after studying its phenotype characteristics and DNA testing , it was determined to be a new , unclassified variety genetically similar to varieties found in the Agaro region of Ethiopia |\n| Blue Mountain | C. arabica | Blue Mountains region of Jamaica . Also grown in Kenya , Hawaii , Haiti , Papua New Guinea ( where it is known as PNG Gold ) and Cameroon ( where it is known as Boyo ) | A unique mutation of Typica , known to have some resistance to coffee berry disease |\n| Bourbon | C. arabica | Réunion , Rwanda , Latin America | Around 1708 , the French planted coffee on the island of Bourbon ( now called Réunion ) in the middle of the Indian Ocean , all probably from the same parent stock - the plant the Dutch gave them . Unsurprisingly , it mutated slightly and was planted throughout Brazil in the late 1800s and eventually spread through Latin America , however , it was not possible to achieve the same level of flavour as when in Réunion , due to the volcanic earth and the soil properties . Bourbon produces 20-30% more fruit than Typica strains |\n| Catuai | C. arabica | Latin America | This is a hybrid of Mundo Novo and Caturra bred in Brazil in the late 1940s |\n| Catimor | Interspecific hybrid | Latin America , Indonesia , India , China ( Yunnan ) | This is cross between Timor coffee and Caturra coffee . It was created in Portugal in 1959 . In India , this cultivar goes by the name Cauvery |\n| Caturra | C. arabica | Latin and Central America | Developed from two cultivars that originated by natural mutation of Bourbon Red , originally a tall coffee shrub , found in the Serra do Caparaó . It produces a higher yield than Bourbon , due to the plant being shorter and with less distance between the branches , matures more quickly , and is more disease resistant than older , traditional arabica varieties . Its mutation is not unique ; it led to the formation of the Pacas variety in El Salvador ( from Bourbon ) and the Villa Sarchi in Costa Rica ( from Bourbon ) . Genetically it is very similar to Bourbon although it produces a poorer cup quality , mainly due to the variety yielding more |\n| Charrier | C. charrieriana | Cameroon | This is a newly found species from Cameroon . It has gained some press recently due to its caffeine-free nature .

His first book , An Astronomicall Description of the Late Comet , was published in 1619 and described the comet of the previous year . He was already known by this time to Sir Henry Savile and Henry Briggs ( who Savile appointed as his first geometry professor ) . After his appointment to the chair , Bainbridge also lectured and practised in medicine . Although only a few other publications of his survive , they have been said to reveal an acute intellect and deep learning . He demonstrated a knowledge of contemporary developments in astronomy , such as the work of Johannes Kepler , and studied Arabic to acquire details of astronomical observations in ancient sources . He also exposed the many mistakes that Joseph Scaliger made when attempting to explain the origins of the Julian calendar in observations of Sirius from ancient Egypt - an achievement that was recorded by his successor John Greaves on his memorial in Merton College Chapel |\n| John Greaves | 1643-48 | Balliol College | Merton College | Greaves began studying astronomical texts in Greek , Arabic and Persian at about the time that he was appointed to a fellowship of Merton College in 1624 . He was appointed Professor of Geometry at Gresham College , London , in 1631 . He undertook an expedition to the Levant region of the Mediterranean in 1637 to carry out astronomical observations and to acquire learned books in oriental languages for William Laud ( Chancellor of the University of Oxford and Archbishop of Canterbury ) . Some of the instruments he took with him are now held by the Museum of the History of Science in Oxford . He returned home in 1640 , and succeeded Bainbridge in 1643 . During the English Civil War , he was expelled from Oxford by the Parliamentary authorities in charge of the university in 1648 , and moved to London , where he published various works drawing upon the research carried out in his expedition . He was a friend of Seth Ward and was able to help him succeed to the chair that he had been forced to vacate |\n| Seth Ward | 1649-60 | University of Cambridge ( Sidney Sussex College ) | Wadham College and Trinity College | When still an undergraduate , Ward impressed John Bainbridge ( the first astronomy professor ) during a mathematical disputation . Ward was appointed as university lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge in 1643 , but was deprived of his fellowship in the following year for refusing to agree to the religious oaths required by the Parliamentary authorities . He spent the following years tutoring and improving his mathematical knowledge , before succeeding his friend John Greaves in the Savilian chair , with Greaves 's assistance . University lectures in astronomy were resumed under Ward , who was the first Savilian professor to teach the Copernican discovery that the Earth and other planets revolved around the Sun . He studied comets and the movements of the planets , observing them from the room at the top of the tower of Wadham College in which he lived ; he also preached and published theological works . He was elected Principal of Jesus College , Oxford , in 1657 , but Oliver Cromwell installed Francis Howell instead , raising Ward 's stipend as compensation . He was President of Trinity College , Oxford , from 1659 but resigned 1660 at The Restoration in favour of his ejected predecessor ; he also gave up the professorship in the same year . He later became Bishop of Exeter and then Bishop of Salisbury , where he did much to restore the cathedrals , but did not continue his astronomical studies |\n| Christopher Wren | 1661-73 | Wadham College | All Souls College | As an undergraduate , Wren joined the circle of mathematicians and natural scientists at Wadham under the leadership of the Warden , John Wilkins . He developed an interest for telescopes and astronomy , building with Wilkins an 80-foot ( 24 m ) long instrument to observe the Moon in 1655 . Oliver Cromwell appointed Wren in 1657 as Professor of Geometry at Gresham College , London , on the recommendation of Wilkins ; Wren lectured on Saturn ( the appearance and phases of which he had earlier studied ) , Kepler 's works , light , and lenses . He provided partial solutions in 1658 to problems relating to curves set by Blaise Pascal , the answers to which would help calculations for planetary orbits . He resigned from Gresham College upon his appointment to the Savilian chair , lecturing on topics such as spheres and navigation . He developed an interest in architecture from his mathematical studies , with early work including the chapel of Pembroke College , Cambridge , and the Sheldonian Theatre in Oxford . His architectural skills led to his role in rebuilding London after the Great Fire of 1666 ( including St Paul 's Cathedral ) and his appointment as Surveyor of the King 's Works in 1669 . Isaac Newton described him as one of the foremost geometers of this age . Wren appointed Edward Bernard as his deputy in the chair in 1669 , on his appointment as Surveyor of the King 's Works , and Bernard succeeded him four years later |\n| Edward Bernard | 1673-91 | St John 's College | St John 's College | Bernard studied Hebrew , Arabic , Syriac and Coptic with Edward Pococke ( Laudian Professor of Arabic at the university ) and mathematics with John Wallis ( Savilian Professor of Geometry ) . When Christopher Wren was appointed as Surveyor of the King 's Works in 1669 , he appointed Bernard as his deputy in the astronomy chair ; he succeeded Wren in 1673 and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on the same day . Bernard 's interests , as demonstrated in his lectures , were more in ancient mathematics and astronomy than in modern developments ; he published comparatively few works . Tiring of his academic duties , he moved to Paris to tutor two of the illegitimate sons of King Charles II , the Duke of Grafton and the Duke of Northumberland , but returned after falling out with their mother , the King 's mistress . He unsuccessfully sought other positions abroad , including the chair of Arabic at the University of Leiden . He resigned in 1691 when appointed to a lucrative parish position as rector of Brightwell-cum-Sotwell near Oxford |\n| David Gregory | 1691-1708 | Marischal College and University of Aberdeen , and Leiden University | Balliol College | Gregory studied in his native Scotland and befriended the Edinburgh physician Archibald Pitcairne before travelling through Europe and continuing his education . He inherited the papers of his uncle James Gregory , a mathematician and astronomer , which he studied carefully . He succeeded his uncle at the University of Edinburgh in 1683 , giving a history of the progress of mathematics as his inaugural lecture . In 1690 , Gregory refused to swear an oath of loyalty to the regime of William III and Mary II but was not removed from his post . He enlisted the support of Isaac Newton and John Flamsteed , the Astronomer Royal , in his efforts to obtain the Oxford chair , and was elected in December 1691 , becoming a Fellow of Balliol and obtaining an Oxford doctorate in February 1692 . As professor , he lectured less often than required by the terms of his appointment , and covered only relatively uncomplicated material rather than Newton 's work . He moved to London in 1704 and was appointed overseer of the Scottish Mint in 1707 to supervise recoinage in Scotland . He died in 1708 . He has been described as not a notable observational astronomer , but instead a talented correspondent , communicator and teacher |\n| John Caswell | 1709-12 | Wadham College | Hart Hall | Carswell matriculated at Wadham College , Oxford , when he was 16 years old , and studied with John Wallis ( Savilian Professor of Geometry ) . He worked with the cartographer John Adams on the survey of Englan",

The complex of six conical shaped mounds was in use during the Miller 1 and Miller 2 phases of the Miller culture . and was built between 100 BCE and 100 CE . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 as part of the Natchez Trace Parkway at milepost 232.4 |\n| Carl Potter Mound | Champaign County , Ohio | ? | ? | Also known as the Hodge Mound II , it is located in southern Champaign County , Ohio near Mechanicsburg , it lies on a small ridge in a pasture field in southeastern Union Township |\n| Conus | Marietta Earthworks , Marietta , Ohio | 100 BCE to 500 CE | Adena culture | The conical Great Mound at Mound Cemetery is part of a mound complex known as the Marietta Earthworks , which includes the nearby Quadranaou and Capitolium platform mounds , the Sacra Via walled mounds ( largely destroyed in 1882 ) , and three enclosures |\n| Criel Mound | South Charleston , West Virginia | 250 to 150 BCE | Adena culture | Located in South Charleston , West Virginia , the mound lies equidistant between two sacred circles , earthwork enclosures each 556 feet ( 169 m ) in diameter . It was originally 33 feet ( 10 m ) high and 173 feet ( 53 m ) in diameter at the base , making it the second-largest such burial mound in the state |\n| Crooks Mound | La Salle Parish , Louisiana | 100 BCE to 400 CE | Early Marksville culture | A large Marksville culture mound site in La Salle Parish in south central Louisiana . It is a large conical mound that was part of at least six episodes of burials . It measured about 16 ft high ( 4.9 m ) and 85 ft wide ( 26 m ) . It contained roughly 1,150 remains that were placed however they were able to be fit into the structure of the mound . Sometimes body parts were removed in order to achieve that goal . Archaeologists think it was a holding house for the area that was emptied periodically in order to achieve this type of setup |\n| Dunns Pond Mound | Logan County , Ohio | ca . 300 to 500 CE | Ohio Hopewell culture | Located in northeastern Ohio near Huntsville , it lies along the southeastern corner of Indian Lake in Washington Township . In 1974 , the mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a potential archeological site , with much of its significance deriving from its use as a burial site for as much as nine centuries |\n| Grave Creek Mound | Moundsville , West Virginia | 250 to 150 BCE | Adena culture | At 69 feet ( 21 m ) high and 295 feet ( 90 m ) in diameter , the Grave Creek Mound is the largest conical type burial mound in the United States . In 1838 , much of the archaeological evidence in this mound was destroyed when several non-archaeologists tunneled into the mound .

Theistic Satanists worship it as a deity or demon , while atheistic Satanists see it as a metaphorical symbol . However , the goat-headed Baphomet image seen here is a 19th century creation first appearing in Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie ( 1856 ) by Christian occultist Éliphas Lévi . It was not originally created as a Satanic symbol and is not representative of the Baphomet associated with the Knights Templar . See also : Sigil of Baphomet and Statue of Baphomet |\n| Black Sun | Nazi occultism and later the neo-Nazi movement | A symbol of the sun composed of twelve sig runes first appearing on the floor of the north tower of Wewelsburg after Heinrich Himmler ordered it to be remodeled , it gained modern popularity due to its use by Nazi occultists . It was later adopted by Satanists . The name Black Sun was coined by Wilhelm Landig of the Landig Group |\n| Circled dot | Alchemy | The alchemical symbol for the sun and various sun gods . Also the alchemical symbol for gold |\n| Cross of Saint Peter | Christianity , later adopted by Satanism | Used paradoxically both as a symbol of Saint Peter and as Anti-Christian sentiment . The symbol comes from the crucifixion of Saint Peter , in which he requested to be crucified upside-down as he did n't see himself as worthy to die the same way as Jesus |\n| Eye of Horus | Ancient Egyptian religion | The eye of the god Horus , a symbol of protection , now associated with the occult and Kemetism |\n| Eye of Providence ( or the all-seeing eye of God ) | Christian iconography | The eye of God within a triangle and surrounded by holy light , representing His omniscience |\n| Heptagram | Judaism , Christianity , Islam , Thelema , Paganism , Alchemy | In Christianity , it represents the seven days of creation . In Islam , it represents the first seven verses of the Quran . It is the symbol of Babalon in Thelema . In Wicca , it is known as the Elven Star , Fairy Star , or Septagram |\n| Hexagram | Mandala and Judaism | An ancient symbol of the Jewish faith , also found on the Seal of Solomon |\nQuestions: [\n        \"What is the origin of the Ankh symbol?\",\n        \"What are the associations of the Ankh symbol?\",\n        \"What is the relationship between the Baphomet symbol and the Knights Templar?\",\n        \"What is the significance of the Black Sun symbol in Nazi occultism?\",\n        \"What is the alchemical meaning of the Circled dot?\",\n        \"How is the Cross of Saint Peter used in Christianity and Satanism?\",\n        \"What is the protection offered by the Eye of Horus?\",\n        \"What is the meaning of the Eye of Providence in Christian iconography?\",\n        \"What does the Heptagram represent in different cultures?\",\n        \"What is the connection between the Hexagram and the Seal of Solomon?\"\n    ]",

He led the league in batting average four times in his career , notching his 3,000th hit in the 1972 season ( September 30 ) . Inducted into the Hall of Fame after his death at sea , Clemente was recognized not only for his statistical achievements over his 17 seasons , but for his humanitarian contributions |\n| Ken Griffey , Jr | 2011 | Griffey was retired at the time of his award after having hit over 600 home runs , winning a MVP Award in 1997 , and being named to the All-Century Team over the course of his career . Commissioner Bud Selig described Griffey in a statement , saying he was a gifted all-around player with a perfect swing , a brilliant glove and a childlike joy for the game . From the time he was just 19 , Ken represented MLB with excellence and grace , and he was one of our sport 's greatest ambassadors not only in Seattle and Cincinnati , but also around the world . I am most appreciative for all of Ken 's contributions to our national pastime |\n| Tony Gwynn | 2001 | Gwynn played 20 seasons with the San Diego Padres , amassing 15 All-Star appearances and leading the league in batting average 8 times .

Jeter is also the Yankees ' franchise leader in hits , games played , stolen bases , and at bats .
