Trevor decided to stay in Cambridge with his friends and family when Sam accepted the professorship position at a university in London and moved away at the end of series three. |\n| Dr. Fred Dale | Sam Parks | Series 1-3 | Fred was Sam's main assistant during post mortems and on visits to crime scenes, often identifying DNA samples at the scene of the crime, and linking them to those responsible. He was also notable for not having many speaking lines, and regularly appearing without speaking. His fate at the end of series three was not revealed. |\n| Dr. Harry Cunningham | Tom Ward | Series 6-15 | Harry started out life as a junior doctor, who worked as an apprentice alongside Sam and Leo. However, he soon qualified as a pathologist, and has worked on equal footing with the team for a number of years. Harry was single, and lived alone, but has had several romantic relationships, including an on-off relationship with his colleague Nikki. Harry left the team to accept a professorship in New York in the episode \"And Then I Fell in Love\" at the end of series 15. |\n| Professor Leo Dalton | William Gaminara | Series 6-16 | Leo first appeared in the episode \"The Fall Out\", where he was nothing more than a simple doctor. However, he was promoted to professor after former professor Sam Ryan left. In the episode \"Ghosts\", both his wife, Theresa, and his daughter, Cassie, are killed in a car accident. He began a relationship with fellow professor Janet Mander in \"Safe\", but ended their relationship in the episode \"Domestic\". Leo often took a strong opinion on cases and often became emotionally involved. He died in the series 16 finale 'Greater Love', when he sacrificed himself to save many others from a terrorist bomb explosion. |\n| Professor Janet Mander | Jaye Griffiths | Series 12-15 | Janet is a psychological profiler who assists the police in cases of serial offences. She began a relationship with Leo in the episode \"Safe\", and they lived together as partners until Leo ended the relationship in \"Redhill\". She recurringly worked alongside the team to provide them with information in order to get an idea of the suspect they are looking for. Janet decided to move away from London after Leo ended their relationship. |\n| Dr. Charlie Gibbs | Wunmi Mosaku | Series 13 | A junior doctor and lab technician, who was appointed to work with the team by Professor Dalton. |\n| Dr. Zak Khan | Arsher Ali | Series 14 | A junior doctor who worked his forensic science apprenticeship with the team, to learn the ropes of the profession. |\n| Wyn Ryan | Ruth McCabe | Series 1-3 | Professor Ryan's sister, who after coming over to visit her from her home in Ireland, ended up living with her on a permanent basis. |\n| Helen Farmer | Clare Higgins | Series 1 | A superintendent, and Tom Adams' boss and mentor, who accompanied him on investigating several cases during his time in the force. |"

He used quite a lot of humour and sarcasm to describe it, which made the auction more fun. His description:\n\"Words cannot express how much I hate this printer. It never works when I need it to - it's like it knows when I have to urgently print something. It randomly decides if it wants to work wirelessly or not. And scanning wirelessly? Forget about it! When you first turn it on it will play an endless symphony of sounds that are simply there to fool you into thinking that it might actually do what it's designed to do. Don't be fooled.

The owner of the bag auctioned it via TradeMe for $22,750, generating a large media-story and over 1 million page-views before the auction closed. |\n| 3 | 810,802 | 18 June 2009 | Mike Whittaker (mikew4) listed his old Kelvinator washing machine under the title 'Scary Washing Machine' due to its behaviour when washing. He created a fictional story about how it sucked his shoes, pants, iron and wife into a vortex, beyond which, there are dinosaurs. The pictures he drew of the supposed dinosaurs are being sold as fund-raisers for NZ charities. T-Shirt company 'MrVintage' has created its own Scary Washing Machine Range of men's and women's T-shirts. The washing machine eventually sold for $5,160. |\n| 4 | 459,420 | 1 August 2012 | The implosion of Radio Network House on 5 August 2012 was New Zealand's first ever controlled building demolition by explosives. Like most other buildings in the Christchurch Central City, Radio Network House was damaged beyond repair in the 22 February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. The right to push the button for the implosion was put up for auction and became the auction with the third highest page views ever. The winning bid was for $26,000 and the consortium of demolition contractors let the Child Cancer Foundation nominate a six-year-old boy from Queenstown. |\n| 5 | 355,889 | 20 January 2012 | YOUR Tattoo on my Bum!! |\n| 6 | 384,705 | 24 May 2009 | Buy a Tractor and get a 20 acre farm for free |\n| 7 | 316,350 | 7 March 2011 | Landscape Rocks for Sale in ChCh (following the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, there was no shortage of rocks, as whole cliffs had collapsed) |\n| 8 | 292,184 | 6 May 2010 | Folden 2010 |\n| 9 | 276,094 | 8 January 2009 | Jesus Christ Pita Bread |\n| 10 | 258,775 | 9 January 2012 | Two days in the studio and advice from Neil Finn |"

Brand | H. Brand | Prepared from urine, it was the first element to be chemically discovered. |\n| 27 | Cobalt | 1732 |  | G. Brandt |  | Proved that the blue color of glass is due to a new kind of metal and not bismuth as thought previously. |\n| 78 | Platinum | 1735 | 1735 | A. de Ulloa | A. de Ulloa | First description of a metal found in South American gold was in 1557 by Julius Caesar Scaliger. Ulloa published his findings in 1748, but Sir Charles Wood also investigated the metal in 1741. First reference to it as a new metal was made by William Brownrigg in 1750. |\n| 28 | Nickel | 1751 | 1751 | F. Cronstedt | F. Cronstedt | Found by attempting to extract copper from the mineral known as fake copper (now known as niccolite). |\n| 83 | Bismuth | 1753 |  | C.F. Geoffroy |  | Definitively identified by Claude François Geoffroy in 1753. |\n| 12 | Magnesium | 1755 | 1808 | J. Black | H. Davy | Black observed that magnesia alba (MgO) was not quicklime (CaO). Davy isolated the metal electrochemically from magnesia. |\n| 1 | Hydrogen | 1766 | 1500 | H. Cavendish | Paracelsus | Cavendish was the first to distinguish H\n2 from other gases, although Paracelsus around 1500, Robert Boyle, and Joseph Priestley had observed its production by reacting strong acids with metals. Lavoisier named it in 1793. |\n| 8 | Oxygen | 1771 | 1771 | W. Scheele | W. Scheele | Obtained it by heating mercuric oxide and nitrates in 1771, but did not publish his findings until 1777. Joseph Priestley also prepared this new air by 1774, but only Lavoisier recognized it as a true element; he named it in 1777. |\n| 7 | Nitrogen | 1772 | 1772 | D. Rutherford | D. Rutherford | He discovered Nitrogen while he was studying at the University of Edinburgh. He showed that the air in which animals had breathed, even after removal of the exhaled carbon dioxide, was no longer able to burn a candle. Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Henry Cavendish, and Joseph Priestley also studied the element at about the same time, and Lavoisier named it in 1775-6. |\n| 17 | Chlorine | 1774 | 1774 | W. Scheele | W. Scheele | Obtained it from hydrochloric acid, but thought it was an oxide. Only in 1808 did Humphry Davy recognize it as an element. |"

I have established my power over them. They have brought tribute to me. That which has been said to them by me they have done. They have obeyed my law. Medea... Arachotia (Harauvatish), Sattagydia (Thatagush), Gandaria (Gadára), India (Hidush).... |\n| c.400-300 BC | Hodu | Book of Esther | says \"Now it took place in the days of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who reigned from Hodu(India) to Cush(Ethiopia) over 127 provinces\" |\n| c. 440 BC | India | Herodotus | Eastward of India lies a tract which is entirely sand. Indeed, of all the inhabitants of Asia, concerning whom anything is known, the Indians dwell nearest to the east, and the rising of the Sun. |\n| c. 300 BC | India/Indikē | Megasthenes | India then being four-sided in plan, the side which looks to the Orient and that to the South, the Great Sea compasseth; that towards the Arctic is divided by the mountain chain of Hēmōdus from Scythia, inhabited by that tribe of Scythians who are called Sakai; and on the fourth side, turned towards the West, the Indus marks the boundary, the biggest or nearly so of all rivers after the Nile. |\n| c. 140. | Indoi, Indou | Arrian | The boundary of the land of India towards the north is Mount Taurus. It is not still called Taurus in this land; but Taurus begins from the sea over against Pamphylia and Lycia and Cilicia; and reaches as far as the Eastern Ocean, running right across Asia. But the mountain has different names in different places; in one, Parapamisus, in another Hemodus; elsewhere it is called Imaon, and perhaps has all sorts of other names; but the Macedonians who fought with Alexander called it Caucasus; another Caucasus, that is, not the Scythian; so that the story ran that Alexander came even to the far side of the Caucasus. The western part of India is bounded by the river Indus right down to the ocean, where the river runs out by two mouths, not joined together as are the five mouths of the Ister; but like those of the Nile, by which the Egyptian delta is formed; thus also the Indian delta is formed by the river Indus, not less than the Egyptian; and this in the Indian tongue is called Pattala. Towards the south this ocean bounds the land of India, and eastward the sea itself is the boundary. The southern part near Pattala and the mouths of the Indus were surveyed by Alexander and Macedonians, and many Greeks; as for the eastern part, Alexander did not traverse this beyond the river Hyphasis. A few historians have described the parts which are this side of the Ganges and where are the mouths of the Ganges and the city of Palimbothra, the greatest Indian city on the Ganges. (...) The Indian rivers are greater than any others in Asia; greatest are the Ganges and the Indus, whence the land gets its name; each of these is greater than the Nile of Egypt and the Scythian Ister, even were these put together; my own idea is that even the Acesines is greater than the Ister and the Nile, where the Acesines having taken in the Hydaspes, Hydraotes, and Hyphasis, runs into the Indus, so that its breadth there becomes thirty stades. Possibly also other greater rivers run through the land of India. |\n| 320 CE or later | Bhāratam | Vishnu Purana | उत्तरं यत्समुद्रस्य हिमाद्रेश्चैव दक्षिणम् ।\nवर्षं तद् भारतं नाम भारती यत्र संततिः ।।\ni.e. \"The country (varṣam) that lies north of the ocean and south of the snowy mountains is called Bhāratam; there dwell the descendants of Bharata.\" |\n| c. 590. | Hind | Istakhri | As for the land of the Hind it is bounded on the East by the Persian Sea (i.e. the Indian Ocean), on the W. and S. by the countries of Islām, and on the N. by the Chinese Empire. . . . The length of the land of the Hind from the government of Mokrān, the country of Mansūra and Bodha and the rest of Sind, till thou comest to Kannūj and thence passest on to Tibet, is about 4 months, and its breadth from the Indian Ocean to the country of Kannūj about three months. |\n| c. 650 | Five Indies | Xuanzang | The circumference of 五印 (Modern Chinese: Wǔ Yìn, the Five Indies) is about 90,000 li; on three sides it is bounded by a great sea; on the north it is backed by snowy mountains. It is wide at the north and narrow at the south; its figure is that of a half-moon. |\n| c. 944. | Hind, Sind | Masudi | For the nonce let us confine ourselves to summary notices concerning the kings of Sind and Hind. The language of Sind is different from that of Hind. . . . |\n| c. 1020 | Hind | Al-Birūnī | Hind is surrounded on the East by Chín and Máchín, on the West by Sind and Kábul, and on the South by the Sea.- |"

It is expected to be lit by Speaker John Boehner during a ceremony in early December. |\n| 2011 | Sierra White Fir | 63 feet (19 m) | Stanislaus National Forest | California | Lit by John Boehner on December 6.

The tree was felled in early November, and delivered to Washington on November 30. The tree was decorated with 10,000 LEDs, and 5,000 ornaments crafted and donated by the people of Arizona.\nA significant portion of the ornaments were created by Arizona school children who were provided with specifications for their ornaments, including the instructions that “[o]rnaments cannot reflect a religious or political theme… Instead share your interpretation of our theme ‘Arizona’s Gift, from the Grand Canyon State.’” The ADF sent a letter to various officials associated with the 2009 tree, on the behalf of Candace Duncan, who's child wished to submit ornaments including the following phrases: \"Happy Birthday, Jesus,\" and \"Merry Christmas.\" The ADF made the argument that the child's First Amendment rights were violated by the restrictions. The instructions for the event were modified by October 1, and no longer included the religious restrictions. A spokesperson for the AOC was quoted as saying the previous instruction contained “old information,” and that “is no longer the position of the agency.” |\n| 2008 | Subalpine Fir | 70 feet (21 m) | Bitterroot National Forest | Montana | The tree was decorated with more than 5,000 ornaments displaying the theme \"Sharing Montana's Treasures\" by shocasing the state's heritage, historical events, and natural resources.

Ben escapes, releases the others and they defeat Diablo. | 9/16/1967 |\n| 3 | 7 | The Way It All Began | While on a television show, Reed recalls the time he first met Victor von Doom before he became Dr. Doom. He had Ben as his roommate at university. Victor was working on dangerous experiments, especially a test that brought him to the hospital and got him expelled from university. Worse than that, the test altered his face and he swore revenge on Reed having to hide his work from him. Ben and Reed became soldiers in World War II. Ben, Susan, Johnny and Reed all went aboard a space rocket for space exploration. And so the origin of the Fantastic Four began. Dr. Doom confronts the Fantastic Four on the television show and briefs them on his origin.

Using a special device, Reed turns Red Ghost into a plastic statue. | 10/7/1967 |\n| 6 | 9 | Prisoners Of Planet X | A UFO has been sighted. The pilot abducts the Fantastic Four from the Science Center and is setting course for Planet X. There, their dictator Kurrgo requests the Fantastic Four save their planet from another planet knocked off its orbit. Reed manages to formulate a working plan to save the population. While the plan is in process, Kurrgo has other ideas. However, Reed tricks Kurrgo and leaves him on the exploding planet while the micro-sized population and the Fantastic Four get away to safety. | 10/14/1967 |\n| 7 | 14 | It Started On Yancy Street | The Fantastic Four face a bunch of old rivals in Yancy Street, but their old enemy Red Ghost and his primates show up and capture them.

They barely manage to get to a source of oxygen which is the Watcher’s laboratory. Using one of the Watcher’s machines, Reed brings down Red Ghost’s ship.

IBM 2741 Selectric-style golf-ball teleprinter for user interface. | Nickel acoustic delay line working storage (8 words of decimal arithmetic). Paper tape and edge-punched cards. Magnetic stripe cards for the teleprinter-style user interface. Could be switched between decimal and Sterling at the flick of a switch as it said in the publicity. |\n| SUSIE | 1967 | Stock Updating and Sales Invoicing Electronically | Programmes (2) stored on drum, each with 1000 machine instructions. Programme could be loaded from or written out to paper tape. User interface as SADIE. | As for SADIE, plus magnetic drum (6k words) |\n| Mark 1 | 1970 | Sales Order processing | Architecture similar to the Data General \"NOVA\" in that the memory and I/O highways were separate whereas DEC used a common highway for memory and I/O with the peripherals occupying memory addresses. The NOVA was a 16 bit design but the Molecular was 18 bit allowing signed arithmetic and a memory parity check bit. The instruction set was in some ways similar to the Nova. The M18 was designed by a small team headed by Colin Chapman & Ian Miller.\nOperating system known as LOS developed by Joe Templeman in Leicester office of Systemation. Programming was done in octal notation machine code in longhand using coding sheets. The 17 bit word allowed the limited storage of 3 bytes per word using \"Metacode\" | Ferrite core memory. from Plessey or Fabritek and later EMM.\nFront-loading disk drive\nOptional paper tape reader D400 front-loading cartridge 875 kbit D800 1.75 Mbit |\n| Mark 2 | 1973 | Sales Order Processing | Totally new processor with hardware interrupt stacking, a variable cycle time and new disc controller. Same basic architecture as the MK1. Used a totally new OS.\nWater-cooled cabinets with remote chiller unit initially, later normal fan cooling. | Fabritek or EMM ferrite core memory. Introduced the DD1600 CDC 9427 top-loading disk drive one fixed one removable and/or a large multi-platter CDC removable disk drive. |\n| Mark 3 |  |  | Designation not used but was effectively the 3ME/6ME which was a MK2 processor modified to run the MK1 OS and application software. Hardware interrupt stacking disabled. Used a low capacity version of the CDC 9427 |  |\n| Mark 4 |  | SOP, Livestock Markets, Paper merchants, Plumbers merchants. | Developed after the demise of BCL by ABS computers. Basically a 6ME in a new cabinet with lead acid battery backed static RAM instead of ferrite core.\nProgramming still done in octal notation machine code in longhand using coding sheets. | Core Memory or static RAM, Introduced the CDC Hawk 9427H disk drive, up to 4 supported per controller, max 2 controllers and/or a large multi-platter CDC D8000 removable disk drive. |\n| Mark 5 | 1984 | SOP, Livestock Markets, Paper merchants, Plumbers merchants. | Basically a re engineering of the 6ME processor to remove redundant stack logic and reduced to 3 boards with a printed circuit backplane instead of the costly wire wrapped backplane used for earlier models.\nHardware re-design by Systemation Developments K. A. Howlett (Keith Alec b1943 son of W A Howlett)with assistance in the final test stages by G. Boote. Cabinet design by Business Computers Systems Ltd. Hardware designed and manufactured by Systemation Developments for Business computers Systems. | Initially large-format Ampex ferrite core memory then static RAM, both introduced by Systemation Developments.\nLater Bank switching memory introduced (32K 18 bit words base memory plus up to 8 X 32K banks).\nFirst sold with CDC Hawk 9427H drives later CDC Lark 2 disk drives. Memory and new RS232 4 port I/O card (Quad I/O) by K. A. Howlett, Lark 2 disc controller by J. Adams. Up to four CDC Lark or Amcodyne drives per controller, max 2 controllers. |\n| Distributor | 1986 | SOP, Livestock Markets, Paper merchants, Plumbers merchants. | Smaller version of the Mark 5 in an oversized PC style vertical cabinet with a CDC Lark 2 drive built in. Designed and manufactured by Systemation Developments K. A. Howlett for Business Computers Systems. A single board processor was developed to replace the 3 card processor and was working but never came to market. At the same time a Transputer based maths co-processor had also been developed. Assembler programming introduced by Systemation Developments with the aid of a third party, running on PC's with the program then downloaded to the M18. | Support for seven additional external Lark 2 or Amcodyne drives 4 per controller including the integral drive. 32K 18 bit words of base memory plus up to 8 32K banks. |\n|  | 1990(?) | SOP, Livestock Markets, Paper merchants, Plumbers merchants. | A single board processor was developed to replace the 3 card processor and was working but never came to market.

One Mexican soldier killed | T |\n| Battle of Goliad | Goliad | October 10, 1835 | Texians captured Presidio La Bahia, blocking the Mexican Army in Texas from accessing the primary Texas port of Copano. One Texian was wounded, and estimates of Mexican casualties range from one to three soldiers killed and from three to seven wounded. | T |\n| Battle of Lipantitlán | San Patricio | November 4–5, 1835 | Texians captured and destroyed Fort Lipantitlán. Most of the Mexican soldiers retreated to Matamoros. One Texian was wounded, and 3–5 Mexican soldiers were killed, with an additional 14–17 Mexican soldiers wounded. | T |\n| Battle of Concepción | San Antonio de Bexar | October 28, 1835 | In the last offensive ordered by General Martin Perfecto de Cos during the Texas Revolution, Mexican soldiers surprised a Texian force camped near Mission Concepción. The Texians repulsed several attacks with what historian Alwyn Barr described as \"able leadership, a strong position, and greater firepower\". One Texian was injured, and Richard Andrews became the first Texian soldier to die in battle. Between 14 and 76 Mexican soldiers were killed. Historian Stephen Hardin believes that \"the relative ease of the victory at Concepción instilled in the Texians a reliance on their long rifles and a contempt for their enemies\", which may have led to the later Texian defeat at Coleto. | T |\n| Grass Fight | San Antonio de Bexar | November 26, 1835 | Texans attack a large Mexican army pack train. 4 Texans wounded and 17 Mexican casualties. Resulted in the capture of horses and hay (grass). | T |\n| Siege of Bexar | San Antonio de Bexar | October 12, 1835 | In a six-week siege, Texans attacked Bexar and fought from house to house for five days. After Cos surrendered, all Mexican troops in Texas were forced to retreat beyond the Rio Grande, leaving the Texans in military control. 150 Mexicans killed or wounded and 35 Texians killed or wounded. | T |\n| Battle of San Patricio | San Patricio | February 27, 1836 | This was the first battle of the Goliad Campaign. The Johnson-Grant venture, the first battle of the Texas Revolution in which the Mexican Army was the victor. From the Johnson forces, 20 Texans killed, 32 captured and 1 Mexican loss, 4 wounded. Johnson and 4 others escaped after capture and proceeded to Goliad. Johnson would survive the Texas Revolution. | M |\n| Battle of Agua Dulce | Agua Dulce | March 2, 1836 | Second battle of the Goliad Campaign. Of 27 men of the Grant and Morris forces from the Johnson-Grant venture-12/15 killed; 6 captured and imprisoned at Matamoros; Six escaped, of whom five were killed at Goliad Massacre | M |\n| Battle of the Alamo | San Antonio de Bexar | February 23 –\nMarch 6, 1836 | Mexican President Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna personally oversaw the siege of the Alamo and the subsequent battle, where almost all 189-250 Texan defenders were killed. 600 Mexicans killed or wounded. Anger over Santa Anna's lack of mercy led many Texian settlers to join the Texan Army. (This battle is considered one of the most famous battles in American history and is the inspiration for dozens of movies and books) | M |\n| Battle of Refugio | Refugio | March 14, 1836 | Third battle of the Goliad Campaign. Texans inflicted heavy casualties, but split their forces and retreated, ending in capture. About 50 Texans killed and 98 captured with some later executions, 29 spared as laborers, survivors sent to Goliad and possibly 80-100 Mexican casualties with 50 wounded. | M |"

Designed to zap a green ray from his antennas to change the size of objects. His picture appears on the wall of Jumba's lab in Leroy & Stitch, along with several other pictures of Jumba and Dr. Hämsterviel's early accomplishments. | Leroy & Stitch |\n| 002 | Purple | Doubledip | A purple opossum-like experiment with two light purple stripes on the back of his ears, beady eyes and an orange nose (In Leroy & Stitch, his nose is dark purple). Designed to double-dip food. His one true place is with Mrs. Hasagawa as one of her \"cats\". He somehow changed in size in Leroy & Stitch. | 220, Leroy & Stitch |\n| 003 |  | Howcome |  | Leroy & Stitch |\n| 004 |  | Squawk |  | Leroy & Stitch |\n| 005 |  | Truxx |  | Leroy & Stitch |\n| 006 |  | Percy |  | Leroy & Stitch |\n| 007 | White | Gigi (also known as \"Yapper\") | She is a white Shih Tzu-like experiment with a purple bow. Designed to annoy people with her constant barking. She behaves like a typical \"good dog\": does tricks, licks her owner's face, fetches the morning paper, etc. Because of her appearance and behavior, 007 was adopted by Mertle and wasn't recognized as an experiment until Jumba saw her. Her episode is named \"Yapper\" after the nickname Lilo gave her, but she is officially \"Gigi\" on the experiment name list in Leroy & Stitch. Her one true place is with Mertle, as her pet. In Leroy and Stitch, it is revealed that she can speak English very well. At the end of the movie, Mertle joins Lilo and Stitch's ʻohana because Gigi wants to be in it with the rest of Jumba's experiments. She is voiced by Tress MacNeille. | 108, 118, 209, Leroy & Stitch |\n| 008 | Orange/Brown | Carmine |  | Leroy & Stitch |\n| 009 |  | Pop |  | Leroy & Stitch |\n| 010 | Green | Felix | A green anteater-like experiment with a small body, mouth, arms and legs, a thin tail with a brushy fuzz at the end, a vacuum-like trunk that can fire lasers, dark eyes, short ears, and three dark-tipped spines. Designed to sterilize, disinfect, and clean everything in sight. However, he had a problem with doing these tasks: he threw anything away, assuming it was trash, and tried to \"sterilize\" anyone, assuming they were germs. 010 was upgraded to try to be less of a neat-freak. Instead, he turned into a dirt-maker, so Lilo gave him to Gantu. Gantu sent 010 to Hämsterviel, who didn't like him and sent him back. Gantu set him free, and Lilo and Stitch found him. Later, after he was upgraded, they sent him back to Gantu, who sent him back to Hämsterviel, who sent him back to Gantu when Woops almost broke his cover. Felix was rescued later in \"Snafu.\" The only thing that 010 can say with both of his upgrades is dirty but with Felix he says it disgustedly while with Oscar he says it happily. Both of 010's names are a reference to the main characters of The Odd Couple. He is voiced by Tress MacNeille in the TV series, while he is voiced by Steven Blum in the anime's dubbed version. | 131, 224, 226, Leroy & Stitch, Stitch! |"

Zurich Kloten Airport, Switzerland\n\nAn El Al operated Boeing 720-058B is attacked by a squad of four armed militants while it was preparing for takeoff at the Zurich International Airport in Kloten. At least 8 passengers and crew were injured during the attack and co-pilot, Yoram Peres, died of his wounds a month later. The plane was severely damaged. A greater disaster was averted when an undercover Israeli security agent stationed on the plane, opened fire at the attackers and killed the squad leader. |\n| 17 December 1973 |  | Lufthansa\n— 'Unnamed Boeing 737'\nFCO → ATH → DAM → KWA | 2 | 2 | 10 | Hijacking -- Hostage taking\n(2 days) | - | —Hijacking on ground at Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport, Italy & hostages freed in Kuwait\n\nFollowing the attack on Pan Am Flight 110, 5 Italian hostages are captured and placed on a Lufthansa airliner, and the pilot forced to fly to Beirut. An Italian customs agent dies in the terminal during the capture of the five Italians. After Lebanese authorities refused to let the plane land, it landed in Athens, where the terrorists demanded the release of 2 Arab terrorists. In order to make Greek authorities comply with their demands, the terrorists killed a hostage and threw his body onto the tarmac.\n\n\nThe plane then flew to Damascus, where it stopped for two hours to obtain fuel and food. It then flew to Kuwait, where the terrorists released their hostages in return for passage to an unknown destination. The Palestine Liberation Organization disavowed the attack, and no group claimed responsibility.\n\nSee also: 1973 Rome airport attacks and hijacking |\n| 8 September 1974 |  | Trans World Airlines — 841\nTLV → ATH → FCO → JFK | 88 | - | 88 | Improvised Explosive Device | Abu Nidal Organisation\n(Suspected) | —Greek airspace\n\nAbout 30 minutes after takeoff, the TWA operated Boeing 707-331B crashed into the Ionian Sea. The out of control aircraft was observed on the flight deck of Pan Am 110. They watched the TWA aircraft execute a steep climb, the separation of an engine from the wing, and the craft spiral into the ocean. All 79 passengers and nine crew members were killed. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the plane was destroyed by a bomb in the cargo hold, which caused structural failure resulting in uncontrollable flight.\n\n\nForty-nine passengers boarded the plane in Tel Aviv for Italy and the United States. They included 17 Americans (plus a baby), 13 Japanese, 4 Italians, 4 French, 3 Indians, 2 Iranians, 2 Israelis, 2 Sri Lankans, an Australian and a Canadian. The nationalities of 30 other passengers and the 9 crew members were not immediately known at the time. Reuters reported a total of 37 Americans aboard. |\n| 27 June 1976 | — | Air France — 193\nTLV → BEN → EBB | 4 | 10 | 260 | Hijacking -- Hostage taking\n(8 days) | PFLP-EO (Palestinian nationalists) & Revolutionary Cells | —Hijacking in Israeli airspace & raid to free hostages at Entebbe Airport, Uganda\n\nThe dead include 4 hostages, 1 Israeli soldier and 7 hijackers.

Ten minutes after takeoff, three Palestinian gunmen hijacked the aircraft. The terrorists, calling themselves the Egypt Revolution, were armed with guns and grenades. During the initial hijacking an Egyptian Security Service agent opened fire, killing one terrorist instantly before being wounded along with two flight attendants. In the exchange of fire the fuselage was punctured, causing a rapid depressurization. The aircraft was forced to descend to 14,000 feet (4,300 m) to allow the crew and passengers to breathe. The ailing plane was diverted to land in Malta.\n\n\nThe chief hijacker threatened to kill a passenger every 15 minutes until his demands were met. An Israeli woman, Nitzan Mendelson and an American, Scarlett Marie Rogenkamp, were executed.\n\n\nOn 25 November, the storming of the aircraft by the Egyptian Al-Sa'iqa (Thunderbolt) unit — Task Force 777 — killed 54 out of the remaining 87 passengers, two crew members and one hijacker. A total of 58 out of the 95 passengers and crew had died and 2 out of the 3 hijackers by the time the crisis was over.

Five men came out and tried to drive it away. The wolf charged at Diamond Jenness after he threw a rock and missed. Jenness grabbed the wolf by the back of the neck, but the wolf turned its head enough to severely bite his forearm. He choked the wolf with his other hand; it released, stepped back, and was shot by another man. The wound was treated and eventually fully healed, but Jenness never contracted rabies despite consistency of the wolf’s behavior with the early stages of the disease. |  |\n| Mike Dusiac, Railwayman |  | ♂ | December 29, 1942 | Possibly rabid | Poulin, Ontario, Canada | Riding a small rail vehicle called a speeder when a wolf leaped at him and bit his sleeve, knocking him down and knocking the vehicle off the track. Dusiac kept the wolf at bay for more than 25 minutes with an ax. He managed to hit the wolf repeatedly but not squarely enough. The wolf was not deterred by an approaching train which stopped to help Dusiac. Several railwaymen came running, but the wolf would not retreat. The men killed the wolf with picks and shovels. The carcass was inspected by a biologist, and it appeared healthy. However, Rutter and Pimlot reviewed the case in 1968 and concluded that it must have been rabid because of the sustained and determined nature of the attack. |  |\n| Zacarias Hugo | 14 | ♂ | 1943 | Possibly rabid | Etivluk River, Alaska, USA | While hunting caribou, Zacarias heard a sound, turned and saw a large black wolf coming for him. It knocked him down and bit his arm, so he could not use his rifle. It bit his legs, back, arm and neck and dragged him 18 metres before abandoning the attack and disappearing. He walked back to camp, but had lost a lot of blood, mostly from his forearm. His caribou skin Anorak protected him from greater injury or even death, but may have contributed to the attack if it caused the wolf to mistake him for a caribou. This attack had long been classified as \"rabid\" because it occurred during an epizootic of the disease in that area and because Zac's father, Inualuruk, tracked the wolf and observed to have been walking at times in the splayed manner of a sick animal. However, neither the fact that the attack was abandoned in the way it was, nor the fact that Zacarias never developed the disease is not consistent with rabies. |  |\n| Thomas Hamilton |  | ♂ | 1950 | Prey-testing agonistic charge | Lower Foster Lake, Saskatchewan, Canada | While out hunting wolves, he laid down to aim his rifle, when the wolves arose and started running at him. He waited for a better shot, expecting the wolves to stop, but they did not. He shot the lead wolf at point blank range, prompting the rest to depart. |  |\n| Alex Lamont |  | ♂ | Summer, 1969 | Prey-testing agonistic charge | Near Wien Lake, Alaska, USA | Lamont saw two wolves running directly at him while walking home. He shot both after one of them bit his leg. |  |\n| Pipeline workers |  | ♂ | 1971-1979 |  | Along the right-of-way for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline, from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, Alaska, USA | There were ten \"bites and charges\", including a seriously bitten forearm. Causes included: a lack of trapping and hunting in certain areas; lack of barriers such as fencing, unsecured attractants such as trash, human attitudes and behaviors such as intentional feeding, and mutual habituation. |  |\n| Infant | 1 | ♀ | Fall, 1975 | Captive | New Jersey | While posing for picture with the wolf at a charity event for the Fund for Animals; it bit the side of her face ripping it open. She was hospitalized and given plastic surgery. | Field and Stream |\n| Dr. Bob Piorkowski, Alaska Fish and Game, and his wife |  | ♂/♀ | October, 1975 | Prey-testing agonistic charge | Tonzona River, Alaska, USA, near Denali National Park | Went outside their remote house near Denali National Park to see why their dog was barking, hoping it was a moose they could hunt. Five wolves came running straight at them, not at the dog, which was more than five meters away. Piorkowski was not ready to fire until the lead wolf was at point-blank range. He shot the next at ten meters away. Both wolves were dead, and the rest fled. Both wolves tested negative for rabies, and Piorkowski had one pelt mounted. | p. 17 |"

When Goo arrives and announces their favorite basketball player, Kendall Gill, is at the Comic Book Store signing autographs, the boys decide to ditch the carnival. This leaves Melanie and Jennifer to work the booth and both end up soaked. But the Comic Book Store is packed and much to Alfie and Dee Dee's surprise their father has to interview Kendall Gill. Goo comes up with a plan to get Alfie and Dee Dee, Gill's signature before getting them back at the local carnival, but are caught by Roger. All ends well for everyone except Alfie and Goo, who must endure being soaked at the dunking booth. | October 15, 1994 |\n| 2 | 1 | The Practical Joke War | Alfie and Goo unleash harsh practical jokes on Dee Dee and his friends. Dee Dee, Harry and Donnel retaliate by pulling a practical joke on Alfie with the trick gum. After Alfie and Goo get even with Dee Dee and his friends, Melanie and Deonne help them get even. Soon, Alfie and Goo declare a practical joke war on Melanie, Dee Dee and their friends. This eventually stops when Roger and Jennifer end up on the wrong end of the practical joke war after being announced as the winner of a magazine contest for Best Family Of The Year. They set their children straight for their behavior and will have a talk with their friends' parents as well. | October 22, 1994 |\n| 3 | 1 | The Weekend Aunt Helen Came | The boy's mother, Jennifer, leaves for the weekend and she leaves the father, Roger, in charge. However, he lets the kids run wild. Alfie and Dee Dee's Aunt Helen then comes to oversee the house until Jennifer gets back. Meanwhile, Alfie throws a basketball at Goo, which hits him in the head, giving him temporary amnesia. In this case of memory loss, Goo acts like a nerd, does homework on a weekend, wants to be called Milton instead of Goo, and he even calls Alfie Alfred. He is much nicer to Deonne and Dee Dee, but is somewhat rude to Melanie. The only thing that will reverse this is another hit in the head. | November 1, 1994 |\n| 4 | 1 | Robin Hood Play | Alfie's school is performing the play Robin Hood and Alfie is chosen to play the part of Robin Hood. Alfie is excited at this prospect, but he does not want to wear tights because he feels that tights are for girls. However, he reconsiders his stance on tights when Dee Dee wisely tells him not to let that affect his performance as Robin Hood. | November 9, 1994 |\n| 5 | 1 | Basketball Tryouts | Alfie tries out for the basketball team and doesn't make it even after showing off his basketball skills. However, Harry, Dee Dee and Donnell make the team. Alfie is depressed and doesn't want to attend the celebration party. However, Goo sets him straight by telling him it was his own fault for not being a team player and kept the ball to himself. | November 30, 1994 |\n| 6 | 1 | Where's the Snake? | Dee Dee gets a snake, but he doesn't want his parents to know about it. However, things get complicated when he loses the snake in the house. Meanwhile, Melanie and Deonne are assigned by their teacher to take care of her beloved pet rabbit, Duchess for the weekend. This causes both Alfie and Dee Dee to be concerned for Duchess when they learn from Goo that snakes eat rabbits. | December 6, 1994 |\n| 7 | 1 | Dee Dee's Girlfriend | A girl kisses Dee Dee in front of Harry and Donnell. They promise not to tell, but it slips and everyone laughs at Dee Dee. Dee Dee ends his friendship with Harry and Donnell and hangs out with Alfie and Goo. Soon, Alfie and Goo finally get the three to talk to each other. | December 15, 1994 |\n| 8 | 1 | Dee Dee's Haircut | Dee Dee wants to get a hair cut by Cool Doctor Money and have his name shaved in his head. His parents will not let him do this, but Goo offers to do it for five dollars. However, when Goo messes up Dee Dee's hair and spells his name wrong, his parents find out the truth and Dee Dee is forced to have his hair shaved off. In addition to that, his friends tease him about his bald head, causing a fight between the boys along with Goo and Alfie. In a b-story, Alfie and Goo try to play a practical joke on Dee Dee involving a jalapeño lollipop. It backfires when Roger is the unwitting victim and it leads to him chasing the boys around. | December 20, 1994 |\n| 9 | 1 | Dee Dee Runs Away | Dee Dee has been waiting to go to a monster truck show all week. But Alfie and Goo's baseball team makes it to the tournament and everyone forgets about the monster truck show. Dee Dee feels ignored and runs away from home with Harry and Donnell. It's up to Alfie and Goo to try and convince him to come home. | December 28, 1994 |\n| 10 | 1 | '\"Donnell's Birthday Party\" | Donnell is having a birthday party and brags about all the dancing and cool people who will be there. Harry says that he knows how to dance so Dee Dee feels left out because he doesn't know how to dance. Later on, Harry admits to Dee Dee alone that he can't dance either and only lied so he doesn't get teased by Donnell. So, they ask Alfie to help them learn how to dance. He refuses to help because Dee Dee previously told on him to Roger about his and Goo's plans to cheat on their math quiz. Alfie eventually agrees, after Melanie threatens to refuse to help him with his math homework. Soon Dee Dee and Harry learn Donnell's secret and were forced to teach him how to dance. After the party, Dee Dee tells Alfie about it and finds out that he knew Donnell was a liar. | January 5, 1995 |"

Julius and William Schwartz platted the Annapolis Park suburb in Westland in 1953 specifically for African-Americans. |\n| 4 | Henry W. Baker House | April 22, 1982\n(#82002922) | 233 S.

Baker, president of the Plymouth Iron Windmill Company, which in 1888 introduced the Daisy air rifle and later changed its name to the Daisy Manufacturing Company. The house is of a fanciful Italianate design, likely based on an illustration in a pattern book. The house was a landmark in Plymouth because of the unusual tower, shaped like a pagoda, atop the mansard roof. |\n| 5 | Tivadar and Dorothy Balogh House | September 30, 2013\n(#13000800) | 49800 Joy Road (Plymouth Township)\n42°21′02″N 83°31′52″W﻿ / ﻿42.350548°N 83.531141°W | Cherry Hill vicinity | The Tivadar and Dorothy Balogh House was constructed in 1958-59 by architect Tividar Balogh for himself, his wife, Dorothy and their family. The house is a two-story cubic structure, clad in redwood siding. The house sits on a partial basement on one side and support posts on the other side. The section beneath the house was originally open; the space beneath gives the house an impressive \"lightness\" and makes it appear to hover above the landscape. |\n| 6 | Thomas and Maria Blackman Bartlett House | June 2, 2000\n(#00000614) | 500 N.

In 1989, the house was moved to its current location and placed on a new foundation. Restoration work was begun in 1994 and finished in 2002. |\n| 7 | Beverly Road Historic District | April 7, 1995\n(#94001428) | 23-45 Beverly Rd.\n42°23′18″N 82°54′06″W﻿ / ﻿42.388333°N 82.901667°W | Grosse Pointe Farms | The Beverly Road Historic District covers the original area of the Beverly Park Subdivision, platted by Henry B. Joy in 1911. The district was one of the earliest upper-class subdivisions in the Grosse Pointes, and marked the change of the area from a farming and summer-home community into an upscale year-round community. |\n| 8 | David and Elizabeth Bell Boldman House | June 2, 2000\n(#00000615) | 3339 S.

The following year, Aruna and Mary Bradford, Moses's parents, followed their son to Canton Township. On arrival, they bought the property this house now sits on; in 1835 they sold the parcel to their other son, Benjamin. In 1860, Benjamin built the house that now stands on the property; it remained in the Bradford family until 1911. |\n| 10 | Jos.

In order to secure one of the eight spots on board, they must first pitch their dream restaurant concept to Robert: Those with the best concepts head into Lake Las Vegas for the first challenge. They'll have to create a restaurant from the ground up with just $500 and six hours to feed 250 hungry guests! The bottom three earners will be up for elimination. | Ammerah, Kimmy | Patrick |\n| 2 | Tantrum in Temecula | The Restaurant Express bus arrives in Temecula, Calif., a small, upscale town with lots of restaurants. The contestants' market knowledge is tested when they must propose to Robert and the mayor a new restaurant that they think could be successful in the town. The winner of the mini challenge will get extra money for the main challenge, where they will test their restaurant ideas on the locals at a lunch fair. The bottom three earners will be up for elimination. | Johnathan | Eric |\n| 3 | Express: Impossible | The Restaurant Express bus arrives in Los Angeles, where the contestants face their first group challenge. Inspired by Restaurant: Impossible, the teams will be given 24 hours and $5,000 to revitalize two struggling restaurants. Robert and two visiting critics will dine at each location to determine who won this round, and who will be off the bus. | Bianca | None |\n| 4 | Battle By the Beach | The Restaurant Express bus arrives at the iconic Balboa Pier in Newport Beach, Calif. The remaining five contestants will each have to open a concession stand with the same three dishes; a burger, a dessert and something on a stick. They also must produce a commercial for their stand. The contestant with the best commercial gets to have their ad play on the pier, but will that marketing advantage be enough to draw the most customers? | Patrick | Eric |\n| 5 | Going, Going, Gone! | The remaining four contestants are given their biggest budget challenge: create a supper club with $1,000 and an empty restaurant shell. They first attend an auction with items that could be a big benefit during dinner service, challenging them to spend wisely for an advantage, with enough money left over for food and supplies. | Eric | Adam |\n| 6 | The Truck Stops Here! | The three remaining chefs are each given a food truck and are challenged on their ability to serve specific groups of diners at three iconic locations: a zoo, an upscale shopping center and a late night bar scene. The winner gets a big advantage heading into the final challenge. | None | Adam |\n| 7 | Vegas or Bust | Jan and Seonkyoung battle to see who would face Adam in the final challenge. Seonkyoung won, therefore advancing herself to the final challenge. The two finalists then competed head-to-head against each other in the same restaurant. In the end, Seonkyoung beat Adam and she won a restaurant in the M, named Jade. | Jan, Adam | Seonkyoung |"
